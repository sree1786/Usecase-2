#   USECASE-2 (Integration GIT,Maven,Jenkins & Tomcat)

# What you will be learn this usecase :

As IT employees we work on many areas ( coding,support,infrastructure ) but while onboarding any new service we really are not aware how exactly code will deploy to production . There  are many possibilities  we can onboard our requirements to production .This use case will explain one of the ways to deploy our code to prod. 

This video  I have explained  how to troubleshoot the issues  also . After this recording was completed I had recorded another video without troubleshooting . But I feel People need to learn how to correct the mistakes also . So I preferred to upload this video . Keep Fail and learn more

# Step4: Create maven project 

create new item --> select maven project--> ok --> chcek Source Code Management --> git-->  delcared 'https://github.com/veejee2331/webapplication.git' (Repository URL)--->Brach to build 'main' --> Goals and option 'clean install package ' --> Then come to Post-build Actions--> Deploy war/ear to a container --> WAR/EAR files --> **/*.war --> Add Containers -->' Tomcat 9.x Remote  ' -->select credentail what you given -->  Tomcat url ' (give tomcat url ex: http://54.152.11.147:8090/) --> Save( select credntial)

# Points need to chcek before click build

Manage Jenkins --> Golbal tool configuration --> 𝐀𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐉𝐃𝐊 𝐨𝐫 𝐧𝐨𝐭
